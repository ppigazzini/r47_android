# Build And Source Layout

## Checked-in defaults

- AGP `8.7.3`
- Kotlin `1.9.22`
- Java `17`
- `compileSdk 35`
- `targetSdk 35`
- `minSdk 24`
- `ndkVersion 29.0.14206865`
- CMake `3.22.1`
- ABI filter `arm64-v8a`
- base `namespace` and `applicationId` `com.example.r47`
- debug builds add `applicationIdSuffix ".debug"`
- release version inputs come from `r47.versionCode`, `r47.versionName`, and
  `r47.coreVersion`

## Build entry points

- `./sync_public.sh` hydrates the upstream core and restores tracked Android-port
  files from `HEAD`.
- `./build_android.sh` is the authoritative Android debug-build entry point. It
  detects Java and the Android NDK, runs `make sim`, stages native inputs,
  copies fonts, writes `android/local.properties`, and runs Gradle clean plus
  `assembleDebug`.
- `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug` is appropriate only when the staged
  native tree is already current and the change is isolated to the Android
  module.
- `make sim` is the generator step behind Android native staging. It produces
  the simulator build plus generated files copied into
  `android/app/src/main/cpp/generated`.

## Canonical versus staged native inputs

Canonical inputs for shared core work:

- `src/c47`
- `dep/decNumberICU`
- generated outputs under `build.sim`
- Android-only code under `android/app/src/main/java`
- Android bridge, HAL, and stub code under `android/app/src/main/cpp/c47-android`

Staged Android inputs built by CMake:

- `android/app/src/main/cpp/c47`
- `android/app/src/main/cpp/decNumberICU`
- `android/app/src/main/cpp/generated`
- `android/app/src/main/cpp/gmp`

Development rule:

- Change the canonical root sources for shared calculator behavior.
- Change the staged tree directly only for Android-specific shims, stubs, and
  build-local files that do not have a canonical root owner.

## Android build flow

1. `sync_public.sh` overlays the upstream core into the working tree and
   restores tracked Android-port files.
2. `build_android.sh` runs `make sim`.
3. `android/stage_native_sources.sh` copies the synced core tree,
   `dep/decNumberICU`, generated outputs, `vcs.h`, and mini-gmp inputs into
   `android/app/src/main/cpp`.
4. `android/app/build.gradle` invokes CMake at
   `android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.
5. CMake builds the `c47-android` shared library from the staged core,
   generated files, Android bridge files, and mini-gmp.
6. Gradle packages the debug APK as
   `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/R47calculator-debug.apk`.

## CI lane

The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` keeps the same
ownership model as the local build:

- it runs on `pull_request`, pushes to `github_ci` and `main`, and manual
  `workflow_dispatch`
- `resolve-upstream-core` resolves the authoritative upstream `master` commit.
- `simulator-tests` syncs that commit into the workspace and runs `make test`.
- `android-debug` installs the pinned SDK, CMake, and NDK versions, runs
  `./build_android.sh`, then records packaging evidence.
- the simulator and Android jobs consume the same resolved upstream commit for a
  given workflow run
- the uploaded Android artifact contains the debug APK plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`,
  `abis.txt`, `zipalign.txt`, `elf-load-segments.txt`, and `BUILD-METADATA.txt`.
- pushes to `main` and manual runs on `main` publish a debug-signed prerelease
  tagged with the upstream short SHA and titled from that same core revision.

The CI lane verifies packaged ABIs and 16 KB alignment. It is not a store-release
lane.

## Verification by change type

- Kotlin-only Android UI changes: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug` when
  the staged native tree is already current.
- JNI, HAL, CMake, or packaging changes: `./build_android.sh`.
- root core or generator changes: `make test` and then `./build_android.sh`.
- CI-only changes: verify `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` against the local
  build contract and the artifact names described above.

## When to rebuild from the top

Use `./build_android.sh` after any of the following:

- a sync from upstream
- changes under `src/c47`
- changes under `dep/decNumberICU`
- changes that affect generated files
- changes to `android/stage_native_sources.sh`
- changes to `android/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`
- changes that alter Android packaging or the JNI bridge surface

## Practical maintenance rules

- Treat the debug APK as a derived artifact, not as the source of truth.
- Keep `README.md`, Gradle literals, and shell-script defaults aligned when
  toolchain versions or package identity change.
- If a change affects both the canonical root tree and the staged Android tree,
  change the canonical owner first and restage.
- Keep artifact naming stable unless the workflow, docs, and release notes all
  change together.
